# AI-Bank-Customer-Complaint-Analysis
Project my team and I made in Aptitude's AI Pre-Internship Program at Citigroup. We used Python and its libraries to analyze a datset of complaints filed to banks, draw business insights from the complaints, and train a machine learning NLP model to classify new incoming complaints.
# Results
This is a confusion matrix that shows the results and accuracies of the classifier model.
